# Friday B&E ordering app 

:bread: :pig: :egg: :bread: :coffee: :coffee:

 - **Format:** Take Home
 - **Duration:** 1 hour (estimate)

## Description

In our Sydney office there's a little friday tradition where the tech team goes out for breakfast to take advantage of a local cafe's cheap bacon and egg rolls (with a coffee). However everyone's preference for breakfast and especially coffee is very different and a little hard to remember. So as good software developers do, we'll right an app for that.

### Requirements

The Breakfast order app will need to accept two json files.
 - price-list.json containing the items on sale at our cafe
 - orders.json containing everyone's orders and the money they are paying.

The app will process these two file and output a JSON array containing the change for each user who ordered something.

Some things we will be looking for
 - Program structure
 - Approach to testing
 - General Ruby experience

We understand that these tests can feel open ended and we don't want you to spend too many hours on it. We just want to learn about how you work. If you are having difficulty completing please just submit what you have letting us know what parts were difficult.
